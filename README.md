**Project**: [drupal.org/project/amazon](drupal.org/project/amazon)

**Drupal Documentation**: [drupal.org/project/amazon](drupal.org/project/amazon/documentation)


####Project Overview

Module development was at a stand still for several years(2013-2014) seeing only minor updates and fixes. During this time Amazon changed the Product Advertisement API, introducing several major changes to the returned XML structure.

Starting now (Summer 2015) the project will be actively maintained and updated.

This includes, but is not limited to regular **design/development sprints**, **encouraged community collaboration** and in general,**major improvements** to the core Amazon Product Advertisement API and supporting modules: Amazon Store, Amazon Search, Amazon Media, etc...

####Design & Development Sprints

Drupal is leading Open Source Content Management Framework and Amazon is the world's largest online retailer. Plain and simple, as the People of the Internet, we should have better high-quality content and on-demand commerce solutions.

As is stands the Amazon API Module Suite is suitable for creating basic "affiliate-esque" type websites. Add the Amazon Store Module and the foundation for on-demand commerce has been set.

**Which is cool...but, it can be so much more**. People don't want to be marketed to – we want to watch engaging how-to videos, read hilarious reviews and skim through “Top 7 Lists” with awesome images.

*“We can't just show value, we have to create it”* **The Internet changed marketing... and it's a good thing.**

####Open Source & The Agile Doacracy. 

The future of complex, yet scalable high-quality content and on-demand commerce is open for innovation.

We need innovative designers, meticulous developers, creative writers, hungry entrepreneurs, persistent project managers, savvy marketers and everyone in between.

It starts with the "Components! Community friendly, modular and highly-responsive components."

####The Foundation - Community Friendly Components
A single person can build a boat, but only a community can build a bridge. Innovation happens when committed people with diverse backgrounds share and integrate meaningful contributions.

The Amazon API Module Suite will will encourage and facilitate open collaboration amongst a variety of stakeholders, users, builders, product owners.

A lofty goal and I'll be the first to admit I definitely don't have all the pieces to the puzzle, but I have hunch it starts with consistent iterations, open dialogue and some good'ol can do attitude.
