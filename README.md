**Drupal Documentation**: [drupal.org/project/amazon](drupal.org/project/amazon/documentation)


####Project Overview

Module development was at a stand still for several years(2013-2014) seeing only minor updates and fixes. During this time Amazon changed the Product Advertisement API, introducing several major changes to the returned XML structure.

Starting now (Summer 2015) the project will be actively maintained and updated.

This includes, but is not limited to regular **design/development sprints**, **encouraged community collaboration** and in general,**major improvements** to the core Amazon Product Advertisement API and supporting modules: Amazon Store, Amazon Search, Amazon Media, etc...

####Design & Development Sprints

Drupal is leading Open Source Content Management Framework and Amazon is the world's largest online retailer. Plain and simple, as a community, we should have better high-quality content and on-demand commerce solutions.

As is stands the Amazon API Module Suite is suitable for creating basic "affiliate-esque" type websites. Add the Amazon Store Module and the foundation for on-demand commerce has been set.

**Which is cool...but, it can be so much more**. People don't want to be marketed to – we want to watch engaging how-to videos, read hilarious reviews and skim through “Top 7 Lists” with awesome images.

*“We can't just show value, we have to create it”* **The Internet changed marketing... and it's a good thing.**
